This is my master thesis project.
My thesis posed the question of, how visual, auditory and haptic feedback could simulate the pain a virtual avatar would be feeling, without causing any real pain for the player. The goals is to enhance the game experience. To this end I modified the first-person shooter Payday 2, to change its visual and auditory damage feedback. Beyond that I added haptic feedback through a haptic vest with integrated vibration actuators as well as cold thermal feedback with Peltier elements. 

I conducted a study to find out how effective the different feedback elements are at simulating pain and how they change the game experience. I found that the combination of the haptic vest and the cold thermal feedback can effectively simulate pain. The participants reported that the game was more fun and immersive when played with haptic feedback. Players also felt like they were playing more cautiously when given haptic damage feedback. However, they were still willing to take risks to achieve the goals of the game. An analysis of gameplay statistics showed none of the perceived changes in playstyle. Players performed neither worse nor better.
